# Shared image plumbing for hack/agent.sh and hack/devcontainer.sh (copied from k8s-ai-platform, kept generic).
#
# Both scripts keep a local image and a Docker Hub copy aligned for the current commit, and the
# rules for that -- what identifies an image, when the remote latest tag may move, how to ask the
# registry a question without pulling gigabytes -- are the same for both. Only the Dockerfile, the
# build arguments and the repository name differ, so those stay in the scripts and this file holds
# everything else.
#
# Sourced, never executed. The caller must set, before sourcing:
#
#   prog                the script's name, used as the prefix on every message
#
# and before calling anything below:
#
#   verbose             1 to echo the docker commands and let setup steps print live
#   image_repo          local repository, without a tag
#   remote_image_repo   repository that sync publishes to and pulls from
#   force_latest        1 to move the remote latest tag even when sync cannot prove HEAD is newer
#   pull_policy         missing|always, the base image refresh policy pull_base_image applies
#
# and must define one function:
#
#   build_image         build "$image_repo:$(current_git_sha)" and "$image_repo:latest"

# directive does it instead. bash rather than sh: the code below uses arrays, `local` and

# SC2154 is off for the whole file rather than at each use. Every variable it flags is one of the
# caller-set names listed above -- that is the contract, not an oversight, and six inline pragmas
# would say the same thing six times while hiding the one place it matters. The cost is that a
# genuine typo in a variable name goes unreported here, so a new caller-set variable belongs in
# the list above where a reader can check it.

# Where a build sends its cache and picks it back up, appended to the caller's build flags.

# BuildKit keeps that cache inside the builder, where it is invisible and unmanaged: Docker Desktop
# prunes it when the disk image fills, and everything a prune discards has to be downloaded again.
# Measured on this checkout, the builder held 55GB of it, 36GB reclaimable, and the expensive half
# is the npm stages. A local export puts the same content in a directory the host owns, so a build
# after a prune costs an import instead of a re-download.
#
# mode=max is load-bearing. The default, min, exports only the layers the final image can reach, so
# for these Dockerfiles it would keep the cheap tail and drop every stage worth caching -- go-tools,
# agent-cli and editor-tools are all intermediate.

# import and warns about it, which would be the first line of every build in a fresh clone.
